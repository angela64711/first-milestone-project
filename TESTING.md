## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Bugs

### Fixed Bugs

#### Bug 1

The four service cards on the home page were not behaving as expected at different breakpoints. Even though they stacked correctly on moblie width, they touched each other when they appeared two or four in a row at larger screen sizes. Many attempts were made to address the issue utilising m- and p- Bootstrap classes and CSS positioning. After a lot of tries I came to the conclusion that the grid was breaking, because cards were placed in the same column. I corrected that, but still the responsiveness wasn't as expected and after researching in Bootstrap, I implemented a card grid, which brought the desired results.

![screenshot](documentation/bugs/bug1-fix.png)

#### Bug 2

The buttons with the links in the bottom of the cards, weren't properly aligned and staying in the bottom of the card. Their position was affected by the length of the text above. Trying to fix the link into a specific position with CSS or mb classes didn't work. To fix that bug I introduced a card footer and set a min card-body length. The code can be seen in the screenshots above.

#### Bug 3

The detailed text of each of the services in the services section was behaving in a problematic way and not responsively. To fix that I took the list out of the paragraph element.

#### Bug 4

Slight horizontal scrolling was visilbe in the home page. Trying to identify each element of the page that might cause it and understanding the inherited Bootstrap margins or paddings didn't help. I switched to the container-fluid class and implemented the following CSS, after researcing CSS tutorials.

### Known Issues

The project is designed to be responsive from `375px` and upwards, at all four screen sizes tested in line with the material taught on the course LMS. 
Service card buttons misalign slightly at some random screen widths, like 1372px and 1566px due to text reflow, as these resolutions are outside the project’s scope, as taught by Code Institute. ![screenshot](documentation/bugs/poor-responsiveness.png) |

> There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of, though, even after thorough testing, I cannot rule out the possibility.
